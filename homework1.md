1. Write a Python program to convert a list of multiple integers into a single integer.

    Simple list: 

   ```python
   [11,33,50]
   ```

    Expected Output:

   ```python
   [113350]
   ```

2. Write a Python program to find the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

   Sample lists:

   ```python
   [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[10,11,12],[7,8,9]
   ```

   Expected Output:

   ```python
   [10,11,12]
   ```
